# hello-world
My first repository!

I followed the instruction in the "Hello World - GitHub Guids".
URL: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

This repository stores "beginners" program for each language: Python, C++, and =MATLAB.
"Hello_???_World" is designed to use as a reference when you have not touched to a particular programming language for a while.
By reading and running it, you should be able to remember your memory and restart your work.

Good luck!
